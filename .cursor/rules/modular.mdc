Do not include root/global styling in component CSS files. Styles go in a dedicated root file.

Use unique and explicit class names: To avoid CSS conflicts between modules.

Separate add/edit modal logic: Different functions for add vs edit (like you wanted for image upload).

Use data attributes on modals to track mode: Example: data-mode="add" or "edit" to dynamically switch behavior.

Always reset modal forms on open/close: To prevent stale data.

Keep API endpoint URLs consistent and parameterized: Use /api/products.php?action=add or edit accordingly.

Use async/await or Promises consistently for API calls.

Centralize repeated logic: Like image upload handled through a single method but parameterized for mode.

Handle errors gracefully: Show user-friendly alerts and log for debugging.

Always validate user input and file types before sending.

Keep modal tabs navigation controlled via JS, with clear active states.
