✅ Time & Attendance System Summary
The most advanced, flexible, and user-friendly T&A system on the market.

🧱 CORE FOUNDATION
✅ Minimum Setup Support
If the user sets up only a pay period and imports employees, the system still fully functions.

Default fallback rules apply:

🔁 Employees are placed on "Open Shift" with:

No strict start/end time

Cross-day clock-in/out support

Auto-pairing logic for in/out based on:

Max 20 working hours per shift

If exceeded, new clock-in = fresh IN punch, not OUT for last one

🕑 SHIFT & SCHEDULE LOGIC
✅ Open Shifts (Default Behavior)
Allows clocking anytime

System intelligently calculates actual worked hours

Used when no shift schedule is defined

Comes with default OT and rounding profiles per pay period type

✅ Smart Shift Matching Engine
User can assign multiple shifts per day

System matches clocking to best-fit shift using:

Time proximity

Shift start windows + grace

Clock-in/out containment

If no shift matches:

System assigns "Default Shift" for the day

Or falls back to “Open Shift”

✅ Shift Priority Rules
Shifts ordered by priority (top-down) per day

Manual default shift setting available for each day

Logic evaluates from priority → default → fallback

📅 SCHEDULING OPTIONS

CORE FOUNDATION
✅ Automatic Public Holiday Injection
All South African standard public holidays are preloaded into the system yearly

System auto-updates annually — no manual config needed for most companies

✅ Manual Override & Customization
Admins can:

Add company-specific public holidays

Disable irrelevant holidays

Modify default holiday names/dates

🕹️ HOLIDAY BEHAVIOR RULES
✅ Shift-Based Public Holiday Categorization
Each shift can define how to treat a holiday if it lands on that day

Configurable Time Category assignment per shift for:

Holiday Worked

Holiday Not Worked

Holiday OT

Example:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Shift: Night Shift
→ On Public Holiday: Assign to “PH Overtime”
→ If Weekend + PH: Override with “PH + Weekend OT”
✅ Weekend Detection Logic
System auto-detects if a public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday

Optional behavior:

If PH lands on Sunday → rollover to Monday

Company toggle: “Enable PH rollover to Monday if on Sunday” ✅

Configurable per holiday, not global only

🧮 TIME CATEGORY ENGINE
✅ Default Categories (Editable)
Normal Time – Rate 1.0

Overtime 1.5 – Rate 1.5

Overtime 2.0 – Rate 2.0

PH Worked – Rate 1.0

PH Not Worked – Rate 1.0

PH Overtime – Rate 2.0

✅ Custom Time Categories
Admins can create custom categories like:

“Sunday OT @ 2.5x”

“Travel Time”

“Call-Out OT”

For each category:

Name

Description

Rate multiplier (e.g., 1.25, 1.50, 2.00)

Color tag (for reporting/visuals)

🛠️ FLEXIBLE TIME ALLOCATION (MANUAL)
✅ Manual Timecard Adjustments
Admins/Managers can add manual time blocks to timecards:

Select Time Category (e.g. “Overtime 1.5”)

Input hours (e.g. “2 hours”)

Add reason/comment

Use cases:

Missed punch due to technical or operational issues

Allowances, bonuses, or compensations

Approved manual top-ups

Example:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
John missed clock-out for extra 2 hrs
→ Admin adds “2h Overtime 1.5x” to timecard
→ Notes: “System outage - confirmed with supervisor”

 Multi-Level Approval Engine Summary
A highly configurable, secure, and controlled approval system for timecards and overtime — tailored per customer.

🧱 CORE PURPOSE
To control the flow of time and overtime data before it reaches payroll, by introducing multi-stage approvals, with customer-specific rules managed centrally from your admin dashboard (techlogin).

🧾 APPROVAL TYPES
✅ 1. Timecard Approval
Full shift records must be approved before export to payroll.

Admin can configure per customer:

Does this customer require timecard approval?

Always Approved (no action needed)

Always Unapproved (needs manual approval)

How many levels of approval?

0 (auto)

1–3 (flexible, set per client)

✅ 2. Overtime Approval
OT calculations must be reviewed and approved separately from normal time.

Admin can configure per customer:

OT must be:

Always Approved (auto-applies)

Always Unapproved (must review manually)

Set approval levels for OT:

From 1 to 3 levels (Supervisor → Manager → Admin)

🛠️ CONFIGURATION PANEL (via techlogin)
📋 Per-Customer Setup Includes:
Require Timecard Approval: ✅ / ❌

Timecard Approval Levels: 0 → 3

Require OT Approval: ✅ / ❌

OT Approval Levels: 0 → 3

Default OT Status: Approved / Unapproved

Default Timecard Status: Approved / Unapproved

✅ Customers cannot access or modify this
✅ Controlled only via internal management dashboard (techlogin)

🧍‍♂️ APPROVER ROLES & WORKFLOW
Role	Approval Rights
Supervisor	Can approve individual timecards or OT per employee
Manager	Can approve groups/departments
Admin	Final approval + export permissions
Approval UI includes:

✅ Approve

❌ Reject

📝 Comment field

🔁 Reassign for re-approval

📤 PAYROLL EXPORT CONDITIONS
Timecard data can only be exported when...

✅ All required approval levels are completed

✅ No pending overtime approvals (if required)

✅ No blocked/incomplete punches

⚠️ Export button disabled or flagged until all conditions are met

🧠 SMART ENGINE BEHAVIOR
Scenario	Result
Timecard set as “Always Approved”	Instantly marked as ready for export
Overtime “Always Unapproved”	Always goes into OT queue for review
2-level approval set	Supervisor approves → Manager must confirm
Only 1 approval level required	First approval finalizes the record
Customer not using OT	OT approval flow skipped entirely
📊 REPORTING & TRACKING
Approval logs (who, when, what changed)

Timecards & OT with pending status are visible

Filter timecards by approval stage

Export reports show approval history

🔐 CONTROLLED ACCESS (via techlogin)
Only your internal team (system managers) can:

Configure approval rules

Change approval level requirements

Toggle auto-approval per customer

Customers (end-users) cannot access this config

🧩 FUTURE-READY
Supports escalation workflows (“X days with no approval → escalate”)

Potential to enable notifications/reminders for pending approvals

Could be extended to leave requests or clocking exceptions
