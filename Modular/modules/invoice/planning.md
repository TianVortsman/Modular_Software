# Document Modal System Analysis & Issues to Address

## Overview
This document outlines all the issues and missing functionality in the Document Modal system that need to be addressed to achieve a flawless workflow for creating all types of documents (Quotations, Invoices, Recurring Invoices, Pro Formas, Credit Notes, Refunds).

## Current System Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Main Table**: `invoicing.documents` - Unified document storage
- **Items Table**: `invoicing.document_items` - Line items for all document types
- **Payments Table**: `invoicing.documents_payment` - Payment tracking
- **Credit Reasons**: `settings.credit_reasons` - Predefined credit reasons
- **Settings**: `settings.invoice_settings` - Document numbering and company info

### Frontend Components
- **Modal**: `document-modal.php` - Main modal interface
- **JavaScript**: `document-modal.js` - Modal logic and interactions
- **Form Logic**: `document-form.js` - Form data handling
- **API**: `document-api.php` - Backend endpoints
- **Controller**: `DocumentController.php` - Business logic

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. CREDIT NOTE FUNCTIONALITY

#### Missing Features:
- **Credit Reason Search**: Database search for predefined credit reasons not working properly
- **Original Product Linking**: Cannot properly link credit note items to original invoice products
- **Credit Amount Validation**: No validation against original invoice amounts
- **Credit Type Logic**: Missing logic for "reason" vs "product" credit types

#### Required Fixes:
```javascript
// Missing: Proper credit reason search implementation
function searchCreditReasons(inputElement, query) {
    // Current implementation is incomplete
    // Need proper API endpoint and dropdown handling
}

// Missing: Original product loading for credit notes
function loadOriginalInvoiceProducts(invoiceId) {
    // Function exists but logic is incomplete
    // Need to properly fetch and display original invoice items
}
```

#### Database Issues:
- `document_items` table missing `credit_type` and `credit_reason` columns
- No proper linking between credit note items and original invoice items

### 2. REFUND FUNCTIONALITY

#### Missing Features:
- **Refund Type Logic**: No distinction between full and partial refunds
- **Original Product Selection**: Cannot select specific products from original invoice
- **Refund Amount Validation**: No validation against paid amounts
- **Payment Integration**: No connection to payment system

#### Required Fixes:
```javascript
// Missing: Refund item management
function addRefundItem() {
    // Function exists but logic is incomplete
    // Need proper refund type handling and amount validation
}

// Missing: Original invoice product selection for refunds
function searchOriginalProducts(inputElement, query) {
    // Function exists but needs proper implementation
    // Should filter by original invoice products only
}
```
